Purpose: If Largeur_du_canal(MHZ) is adjusted to keyword, visualize the utilization of different channel bandwidths.
Data Table:

Type: Data Table
Purpose: Provide a detailed view of the raw data, including all key fields.
Additional Considerations:
Interactive Elements: Use Kibana's interactive features like filters and drill-downs to allow users to explore specific aspects of the data.
Dashboard Layout: Organize the visualizations logically. Group related metrics and ensure the dashboard is easy to read and interpret.
Testing and Iteration: Once you've created your dashboard, test it with end-users and iterate based on feedback to ensure it meets the needs of your audience.





Creating detailed visualizations in Kibana for your dashboard involves several steps for each type of visualization. Here's a guide for creating each suggested visualization based on your Elasticsearch data:

1.Frequency Band Distribution
Pie Chart or Bar Chart
Steps:
Go to Kibana Visualize: Open Kibana and navigate to the "Visualize" application.
Create New Visualization: Click on "Create New Visualization" and select either "Pie Chart" or "Bar Chart".
Select Index Pattern: Choose your telecom-* index pattern.
Configure the Aggregation:
For a Pie Chart: Use "Split Slices" and select the Terms aggregation for the fréquences(MHZ) field.
For a Bar Chart: Set the X-axis to use a Terms aggregation on the fréquences(MHZ) field.
Adjust Settings: Set the size of the buckets to capture all distinct frequency bands. You might also want to order by count to see the most used bands first.
Save Visualization: Give it a descriptive name and save.
2. NodeB Deployment Over Time
Line Chart or Area Chart
Steps:

Create New Visualization: Choose "Line Chart" or "Area Chart".
Select Index Pattern: Use telecom-*.
Set Y-Axis: Use Count to show the number of NodeB stations.
Set X-Axis: Use Date Histogram on the Date_mise_en_service field.
Customize: Adjust the interval (e.g., monthly, yearly) to suit your data's density.
Save Visualization.
3. Provider Distribution
Bar Chart
Steps:

Create New Visualization: Choose "Bar Chart".

To create the visualizations in Kibana for your "Mauritania Telecom Insights" dashboard, follow these detailed steps for each visualization:

Spectrum Allocation Overview

Visualization: Vertical Bar Chart
Setup: Use the Lens feature to drag and drop your operator field to the Horizontal axis and the fréquences(MHZ) as buckets on the Vertical axis. Aggregate the frequencies using the Count metric to show the number of allocations per band, stacked by operator.
Technology Deployment Timeline

Visualization: Line Chart or Timelion
Setup: Create a new visualization using the Lens or Timelion. Select the activation_date for the X-axis using the Date Histogram. Use the technology field to split the series and display each technology's deployment over time by each operator.
Network Coverage Map

Visualization: Maps
Setup: Use Kibana Maps and add a new layer using the documents containing location data. Use the term join feature to differentiate the operator and technology fields, displaying each operator's coverage area and technology type.
Operational Sites Growth

Visualization: Area Chart
Setup: In Lens, select the activation_date for the X-axis and choose the Count of records for the Y-axis to represent the number of sites. Split the series by operator to compare growth over time.
Frequency vs. Technology Usage

Visualization: Bubble Chart (Custom Visualization)
Setup: Since Kibana natively doesn't support bubble charts directly, you can approximate this with a Lens visualization using the fréquences(MHZ) and technology fields. Alternatively, consider using Vega for custom visualizations if you're comfortable with it.
Additional Tips:

Filters and Controls: Add input controls for dynamic filtering by operator, technology, and fréquences(MHZ) to allow interactive exploration of the data.
Data Preparation: Ensure your Elasticsearch index patterns are correctly mapped, especially for date fields and geolocation fields, to enable the appropriate visualizations.
Customization: Leverage the customization options in Kibana Lens and Maps to tailor the appearance of your visualizations, including colors, labels, and tooltips, to make the dashboard intuitive and informative.
