1. Average Network Capacity Over Time
Go to Kibana > Visualize > Create new visualization > TSVB.
Set the Data View to fh-* to include all relevant operator data.
Under the Panel Options, set the Time Field to Date-de-mise-en-service.
Move to the Data tab and under Metrics:
Select the Aggregation as Average.
Choose the Field Capacité-en-Mb/s.
Under Panel Filter, write a query to filter the data if needed.
In the Group by, select Terms and then select the OPERATEUR field to separate the data by each operator.
2. Service Commissioning Timeline
Follow the initial steps as above to set up TSVB.
In the Metrics section:
Choose Count as the aggregation to count the number of links commissioned over time.
Group the data by Date Histogram and set the field to Date-de-mise-en-service for time grouping.
Optionally, add a secondary grouping by Terms to separate the count by OPERATEUR.
3. Technology Adoption Rate Comparison
Set up TSVB as before.
In the Metrics section:
Choose Count or Unique Count if you're counting unique instances of technology adoption.
Use the Group by feature to split the series by Type-de-liaison and then by OPERATEUR.
4. Geographical Coverage Comparison
Since TSVB doesn't support geospatial data directly, you might need to represent geographical coverage using a count of unique geo-points or distances.
Under Metrics:
Use Count as the aggregation to count unique coordonnées-A or coordonnées-B.
Group by Terms for OPERATEUR.
5. Frequency Band Usage
Under Metrics:
Select the appropriate aggregation to count or average the usage of frequency bands.
Group by Terms for Bande-de-fréquences-et-fréquence-centrale and then by OPERATEUR.
